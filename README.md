### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I have over 15 years of experience in software development, and have focused exclusively on blockchain technologies
since Jan 2017. Some highlights I am proud of there:

**"Father of CosmWasm"** - CosmWasm is a [Rust SDK to build smart contracts](https://github.com/CosmWasm/cosmwasm) as well as
[a VM that can be easily embedded](https://github.com/CosmWasm/wasmd) into many different blockchains.
This is currently live on over 20 public mainnets, and is second to only the Ethereum EVM on the chains it supports.

  * [CosmWasm Academy](https://academy.cosmwasm.com)
  * ["The Book"](https://book.cosmwasm.com)
  * [CosmWasm Github](https://github.com/CosmWasm)
  
**Founder of Confio** - I co-founded [Confio GmbH](https://confio.gmbh) in 2020 to build a team capable of delivering the
vision of CosmWasm. We are now around 25 talented individuals all around Europe making enormous open source contributions.
I had to learn lots about business and how to fund a pure open source project via grants and project work. I am proud to
have gathered such an amazing team, and even more so, that they enjoy working here.
