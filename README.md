I have over 15 years of experience in software development, and have focused exclusively on blockchain technologies
since Jan 2017. Some highlights I am proud of there:

**"Father of CosmWasm"** - CosmWasm is a [Rust SDK to build smart contracts](https://github.com/CosmWasm/cosmwasm) as well as
[a VM that can be easily embedded](https://github.com/CosmWasm/wasmd) into many different blockchains.
This is currently live on over 20 public mainnets, and is second to only the Ethereum EVM on the chains it supports.

  * [CosmWasm Academy](https://academy.cosmwasm.com)
  * [Base contracts](https://github.com/CosmWasm/cw-plus) - Something like "Open Zeppelin" for CosmWasm
  * ["The Book"](https://book.cosmwasm.com)
  * [CosmWasm Github](https://github.com/CosmWasm)
  
**Founder of Confio** - I co-founded [Confio GmbH](https://confio.gmbh) in 2020 to build a team capable of delivering the
vision of CosmWasm. We are now around 25 talented individuals all around Europe making enormous open source contributions.
I had to learn lots about business and how to fund a pure open source project via grants and project work. I am proud to
have gathered such an amazing team, and even more so, that they enjoy working here.

**Early Contributor to Cosmos** - You may have heard of the Cosmos Hub ($ATOM) or the [40+ connected blockchains](https://mapofzones.com/)
that comprise the "Cosmos", [based on IBC](https://medium.com/cosmic-cartel-boring-dao/ibc-over-troubled-waters-a54c09965fd). 
I worked on the foundations in 2017-18, [creating the original Cosmos SDK](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/graphs/contributors) 
and writing the first working prototype and technical specification of IBC, among other things.

------------

Beyond these technical contributions, I have tried to make a larger impact. I joined blockchain not due to interest in token value, but rather
to learn how one could create programable money and a sovereign governance structure that would support community currencies at scale,
with completely different economic logic than the larger market economy. Unfortunately, I have not gotten anywhere close to that, but
I am collaborating in a few other projects that seek to use blockchain to make positive social impact:

* [WyndDao](https://docs.wynddao.com) - Shifting DeFi towards ReFi (regenerative finance) by building sustainable DeFi protocols that
donate 25% of all revenue to real-world enviromental causes. In development, protocols launch Q3 and Q4 2022.
* [DAO DAO](https://daodao.zone) - A DAO to create DAO tooling. Building cutting-edge technology for decentralized governance and organizations
in order to empower the next-generation of collaborative blockchain projects. They also have built an amazing community and have done no token sale.
